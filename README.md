# Ola Vulnerability Scanner

A Python script designed to perform basic vulnerability scans using `nmap`. The script allows users to input an IP address and automatically performs a version scan on the specified target.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Python script, `olavuln_scanner.py`, which leverages `nmap` for vulnerability scanning. The script executes a scan on a user-specified IP address and saves the results to a file.

## Features

- **Version Scan**: Performs a version scan using `nmap` to identify the services running on the target IP.
- **Result Storage**: Saves scan results to a text file named after the target IP address.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback if the scan encounters issues.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
- **nmap**: Install `nmap` on your system.
